Overburdened Teachers and the Need for Personalized Feedback
Teachers in schools, coaching centres, and colleges often face a heavy workload when providing individualized feedback to students in large classrooms. Manual grading and feedback processes are time-consuming, leaving educators with limited time to focus on teaching and mentoring. This challenge is particularly acute in under-resourced settings, where teacher-to-student ratios are high. As a result, students miss out on personalized guidance, which is critical for their academic growth and success.
